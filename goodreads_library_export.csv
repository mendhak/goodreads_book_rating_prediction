It's a lot about context - you had to know that this book is considered a classic and you had to know that it's the book that started the whole cyberpunk genre. But since I didn't know any if that, I treated it as any other book. Since I've read a lot of scifi before this, and keeping in mind that other authors got their ideas from this book, Neuromancer felt stale and unoriginal. There was nothing special about it, save for the excessive cliches in every paragraph.<br/><br/>3. You have to buy into the hype - else all you have is a normal book with flat, dimensionless characters, a poorly flowing storyline set in a world of computers that authors are so eager to visualize and build upon with little to no understanding of it. It's like akira (anime) or 2001 (movie). They are now famous for being famous. Some will love it, some won't get it because it has no relevance to them. That's how I started Neuromancer as well, only finding out later that you're supposed to love it or clearly yours is not an opinion worth having. <br/><br/>I'm sure I would have liked it if it were one of my earliest books. Alas, it comes in after years of the same kind of thing. <br/><br/>To use an analogy, it would be like watching the first live action Batman series after having seen the Dark Knight movies.",,,1,0

I have no idea how accurate it was as a depiction; it felt like a glimpse into the world of authors, and their minds and insecurities and jealousies.

That's just speculation of course, I have no idea about the author themselves, I tend to do my best to avoid getting to know about the people who write the things I read. The reason being that if you dig, then at a certain point you will learn that everyone is a raging asshole scumbag, and if you try to avoid books by authors for reasons of morality around any-given-subject, you will never read anything at all. <br/><br/>It felt pretty funny to know that somewhere, an author will have read some of my scathing 1-star reviews of their books and perhaps even reread it a few times like poking at a scab, their agents telling them not to obsess over the opinions of a nothing random like me, and yet they simply cannot help it. We, the swarm that infest the online world, are not worth paying attention to, we on Goodreads, Xitter, Tumblr, Reddit, wherever we gather like vultures to a feast. Moral outrage is a manufactured industry to keep attention in social media, ultimately it's the platform owners seeking to profit, not foster useful dialogue. <br/><br/>Anyway about the book — good story, it drags a bit in the middle, and some of the brand and product name mentions felt cringy to me, IMO there should always be an effort to not name the brand, just name the device.

It turns out the drama was added for the sake of it. One of my least favourite tropes in all media is situations which could have been resolved if two people talked to each other.

I genuinely felt my time being wasted away as I worked my way through the self insisting tripe, the mundane conversations trying to show how matter of fact and wizened everyone was with life lessons.<br/><br/>That's what the passages are like. Nobody could get through a coffee order without going through some childhood trauma or other irrelevant stories for no reason other than filler. It was like watching paint dry on a rainy day. You're not even sure the paint is drying, but you’re still sitting there, staring at it, wondering why you started in the first place, waiting for it to dry and when it finally does you realise it wasn't worth the wait. <br/><br/>The reason for that became pretty obvious as the ""story"", such as it was, progressed: without the reams of literary fondant coating it, the plot is just shit. Major plot points were so obvious early on that it felt like a relief when they finally happened (biggest of all Jimmy and Dave). The actual mystery though, unsatisfying in its useless revelation, gets hand waved away in a couple of paragraphs as an afterthought and self justifying mental gymnastics. Yep really. Nobody cared. <br/><br/>It wasn't even stinkingly bad shit, it was just the dry dessicated husk of shit, a long forgotten memory of a passing fox or a dog, left after a long, unrelanting summer, the kind where your skin's baking and everyone's roasting, inducing a general malaise and community lethargy, but everyone's maintaining a sense of civil niceness, since we're all humans after all and just two square meals and twenty degrees away from a barbaric breakdown of society.",,,1,0

There's a dome, as the title says, in which tiers of humanity live in, protected from the outside world and managing diminishing resources. A group of friends discover the truth about the elites though.<br/><br/>So far so good. What isn't so good is the cliched characters. The main character is just an asshole. He has main character syndrome and is somehow always the victim, yet constantly sizing others up and fighting for no good reason. His friend Allie is little more than a cardboard cutout, she exists only as his crutch. Romeo is a comedy relief and punching bag. There is only one reaction people have, eyeroll. It gets noticeably repetitive. <br/><br/><br/>The dialog is a bit cringe at times but not terrible. What's jarring is the forced anachronistic phrases. One person didn't know what a museum was, but later tells someone they're not supposed to know about winter because they live in a regulated atmosphere. The trouble with a group knowing some words and not others just doesn't work. They keeps appearing in phrases and expressions. It's better to just not engage in it at all. <br/><br/>Similar issue with the 'code' that they are cracking. I don't know if these two main characters are braindead or suffering some vitamin deficiency, but they made it look like reading the first word of every sentence was a code that needed cracking. Is this for real? Again, perhaps it was better not to show too much at all. <br/><br/>Overall an ok book, kind of short but needs work on editing.",,,1,0

Two love interests for no reason that contributes absolutely zero to the story, check. She's clumsy but somehow supertalented, check. Angry all the time, check.

No time to dwell on it, she's about to be handed yet another alien power because she is the special one.

But portraying Brits as a bunch of Americans crosses the line. <br/><br/>The story is set in London, but it’s full of mistakes that make it hard to enjoy. Characters tip everywhere, which isn’t common in the UK, and the main character keeps talking about tipping, a bit too much. There’s a freezer full of Lean Cuisines, which isn’t typical either. There are phrases like being ""sent down to Wales,"" a geographic impossibility in London, and the fact that nobody says that. Also, people here don’t describe others as ""Arab-Britons"" or ""Anglo-Saxons."" These are derivatives of a very specific Americanism, one that I find uncomfortable and unwelcome.  <br/><br/>These self-inserts are distracting and make the characters seem American, not British. In fact, the entire country seems to be full of Americans saying American things and doing American things. I wish the setting were US based so that I wasn't constantly being taken out of the immersion.<br/><br/>To add to the distraction, there is a lot of infodumping. There's so much infodumping that there are characters who have been brought in for the express purpose of being additional infodumpers to add on to the infodumping, and nothing else. About midway through the book there is a sudden veer in the direction of the plot which just appears out of nowhere and nowhy. <br/><br/>The story has potential, there's some nice world building and premise that could exist here, I'm genuinely still trying to look forward to see what happens, but these errors and bizarre directions ruin the experience.<br/><br/>Another 'quality' Goodreads choice award.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>* Lead mining was in decline in the 1700s. Nobody was being 'sent to the mines' then. <br/>* <i>""I'm switchin' the cameras to night vision"" said a nerd with a thick Cockney accent.</i> Are you serious.<br/>* Sidewalk, blueberry pancakes, cell phone, couch... what??",,,1,0

You will help generate a story outline for a book called The Women. The aim of the book is to be generically appealing enough, and to masquerade as a sweeping faux-epic, that it will net a goodreads choice award from people who can't tell good writing from a butterfly, like the meme (if they could read this they'd be mad). Actually, they might not even be able to tell that this is a novel, so please append ""a novel"" to the title so it is clear it is a novel. <br/><br/>Despite the misleadingly pluralised title, it needs to be mostly about one woman, the protagonist. Ensure that she has zero personality, attributes, morals, and motivations, so that her narcissistic shallowness can act as a self insert for readers. <br/><br/>Her primary skill should be standing around looking helpless and sorry for herself so that everyone is compelled to assist her and hand her plot devices on silver platters. Every man must fall in love with her and every woman must be her best friend, ready to drop everything and assist her in every way possible. Naturally, she must not reciprocate or help others, she exists only to be served. <br/><br/>To make her relatable to modern audiences, portray her with the vibes of an ""Instagram influencer before her time, on an egotourism holiday""; have her act as a saviour to the hapless village people of the country she is in. Their existential plight as props is inconsequential against her need to virtue signal her sadness for the orphans. Similarly, the issues around the effect of wartime on people and psyches are to be given less emphasis next to her need to lurch from one farcically contrived soap opera melodrama to the next shoehorned romance. <br/><br/>Apply generous doses of plot armour so there is never a sense of danger or conflict. However we do need to showcase a sense of grittiness, so remind readers of the smell of shit when there is a need to walk around the camp. Shit is grit. <br/><br/>To achieve the appearance of a sweeping epic, the story must cram together every war story cliché imaginable. It would be very helpful if the passages were written like a screenplay, to ensure ease of adaptation and of course future royalties from the trite movie that Hollywood generates from it.<br/><br/>Assistant:",,,1,0

And best of all it's also got a theme of ""forgotten"" history. <br/><br/>The world building is vast and detailed, and spans hundreds of years. There are a lot of people and places mentioned. You absolutely need to have its <a href=""http://www.davidweber.net/files/downloads/safeholdMap.jpg"">map open</a> alongside to get a good idea of where the people are and what they're up to. The people's names can get confusing as well, as they are names we'd recognize today but spelled different to indicate a vowel and pronunciation shift; my advice there would be to subvocalize or even vocalize some of the names so that they make sense. <br/><br/>With these points and tools in mind, the story can be really enjoyable; the buildup, the bits of history, the mixtures of science fiction in the fantasy world, and ideologies are really well woven together.<br/><br/>Without these, I think I can see why many reviewers didn't like it, there are indeed a lot of names and a lot of places, and this isn't meant to be a casual read at all. Put the time and effort towards it, and it will reward you.<br/><br/>In my case I moved from reading it on an ereader to straight on the computer; I had the book open on one monitor, the map open on another, and a local LLM helping me understand a lot of the nautical phrases and terminology.

In terms of storytelling the author is finding his feet quite well now and there is a lot stuffed in here. It did occur to me that if I had a gap in between the books, I'd have completely lose the chain of events and wouldn't remember who or what is who or what. <br/><br/>The story's weak point is once again the structure of the 'dungeons'. The author keeps trying to scale dungeons in which each floor's events take place but it's not always easy to follow. That said, this entry was easier to follow than the previous as it was enough to understand that they were in the sand area or water area, etc.  But not much more than that, and it was still a tangled mess. <br/><br/>I'm still sticking with the series because it's not that terrible, but not looking forward to another complicated layout, if there is one. I've seen this handled in similar books with helpful diagrams throughout the pages (as opposed to just the beginning), as the scenes shift, which helps orient the reader. <br/><br/>",,,2,0

Through this story I saw several parallels to our own current society, which makes it interesting to relate to, and realize, we haven't changed that much! <br/><br/>Despite delivering lectures and philosophizing on the moral implications of their actions at the drop of a hat, none of the people in the book feel like cardboard cutouts, everyone seems to have their own backgrounds and motivations; nobody feels like a terrible person despite the interpersonal conflicts which thankfully aren't over-the-top. <br/><br/>The setting is somewhat based on Oxford, the romanticized Oxford of the before times.

He doesn't have to struggle or work for anything. This is not the same storyline or protagonist you've started with. It's like the author got bored or couldn't figure out how to write the story of his progress, how to get him to where he is today.

The author's writing is great and really sucks you in.  Even a mediocre paragraph was made eloquent by his skill.  Just that the poor storyline became so blatant and obvious that it distracted from the immersiveness and was no longer bearable.  It was so unbearable that the 4-star rating that I felt at the beginning became a 1-star at the end for the sake of propriety.<br/><br/>tl;dr: This was a fantasy series which was promising to be unlike any other, only to fall back to old tricks and generic plotlines.",,,1,0

A Swedish man makes his way on the trans Siberian express, and stays a while in Korea. <br/><br/>He collects various species of birds, and in his travels, records his observations of Korean people and customs and culture. It's certainly a different telling compared to what we know of it today: the peninsula was still united, it was under Japanese occupation, and the economy was greatly agricultural. It's a far cry from the modern Korea that comes to mind. <br/><br/>The telling is very matter of fact and sometimes unfiltered (but reflective of common attitudes of the time) and the author doesn't offer personal opinions frequently which is quite refreshing. Still, it's quite clear just how much he was appreciating the beauty of the country side. <br/><br/>Because it was the early days of tourism (not even mass tourism), his travels were a kind of a big deal, he was able to get many people to pose for photographs, which are included in the book. <br/><br/>The author's hobby is bird collecting and he spends time in between describing his finds. There were a few passages where he describes some hunting trips... which doesn't hold the same prestige today that it might once have, but those passages are skippable.<br/><br/>It felt quite relatable to see that even back then, people liked the idea of travelling, and travellers, and photography, and hobbies. We see the past with a distant lens, but reading something like this made quite clear just how similar we are. <br/><br/>I'm very glad to have found this, it would have been another interesting memoir lost to time and I'd be none the wiser. It also makes me wonder what other gems I might be missing.",,,1,0

The first part of the book is padded with irrelevant and inconsequential filler material. It's the same tired route of humanity's factions turning on each other yet again, until there's yet again the external threat. <br/><br/>The scenes in the ""unspace"" are too metaphysical to be interesting, and I think the attempted descriptions of the action in this place where things ""are"" but not really, are difficult to follow. The frequency with which they are entering and being pulled out of that place to deal with yet more inconsequential filler turned the book into a slog.<br/><br/>What's worse is how utterly useless everyone else becomes in the face of the external unspace metaphysical threat, they are pretty much just standing around as the author struggles to find stuff for them to fill the pages.

This was a great tour of the culmination of knowledge of our understanding of the universe, and if you have any interest in popular science I'd recommend this.<br/><br/>It was also quite sobering to realize how little we know about dark matter itself, and how much hand waving goes on around it.

The first book was very obviously a 'transition' piece to set people up for the second book.  That was OK.  But the the second book, sadly, was also a transition piece, setting people up.  I finally thought there would be a story here, but not much luck again, it's transition, setting up, and a tiny bit of story.  <br/><br/>The problem is that everyone is mysterious and powerful and hiding things, and it's meant to keep the draw for the story going, but this particular series goes overboard with the number of things kept mysterious to the point that I stopped caring.  Many of these people are also a lot of bark with no bite as one after another they rapidly come into contact with even more powerful people which takes away the awe.  <br/><br/>The magic system is a bit too clinical and sterile, there are strict ranks with names, and you're meant to level up, and it's meant to take years (but of course not for our plucky protagonists, oh no, they are too special but the why is a mystery, obviously).  Even certain characters for whom said system should be irrelevant, they still speak about those specific level names.  <br/><br/>Lindon is actually a pretty decent character as far as YA protagonists go, he's actually well mannered and not haughty, which I found to be quite refreshing. Sadly he is let down by the writing: he keeps gathering new secret items for later use, and everyone keeps handing him shortcuts to new powers (while saying that there's no such thing as shortcuts... like whatevs), and free training.  As a result, Lindon doesn't have any character progression, he's just, like, some guy. <br/><br/>In fact, it feels like most of the book is training.  Nothing much happens.  The few bits of story that do happen, happen ""because reasons"".  Again, not a terrible thing in itself, but overused, has a way of spoiling enjoyment.  <br/><br/>Really unsure whether to proceed with this series or not, it's been 3 books of not much happening and very little expained.",,,1,0

And it is as deep as a puddle in the content, characters, and messages that it delivers. <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me was that there is just enough world building and premise within this story that it could have been turned into something with a lot of potential.  But it doesn't.  It drives home a very clear message with consistently. If you are ugly, you are evil.  If you are evil, you are ugly.  <br/><br/>There are moments when this very consistency is questioned, or played upon ever so slightly, but a few moments later, with consistency, that line of questioning is discarded in favour of the ever pervasive shallowness.  Perhaps it was not entirely a loss, for I learned a lesson that I have learned many times in the past, to not judge a book by its cover. I chose the book based on its beautiful cover illustration, only to learn later what an evil its contents are... <br/><br/>The story cannot decide what it is trying to do, at times it seems there is going to be some kind of lesson or event on the horizon, at times there are events happening for no reason and purpose. The characters flip flop more than a fish out of water in their motivations and actions, and it gets tiring to keep up with these new threads that lead nowhere.  <br/><br/>At some point the story realizes that it has overstayed its welcome and rushes the ending in a completely unsatisfactory way.  I felt a fool for having stuck with the book in the hopes that there would be some turnabout, some twist, some lesson I didn't see coming, some nuance.    <br/><br/>This is absolutely not a healthy book for young adults and middle graders to be reading, it is toxic and damaging, and I was appalled that it has been tagged as such and is being reviewed so highly.",,,1,0

There's an unending battle between the good and evil sides, and just when you think justice will be served, evil  manages to wriggle and escape.  <br/><br/>Now normally in the stories, justice does eventually get served towards the end.

The style is written like an author from, and with a style from the 1800s.  It has long, dense sentences with words that I don't normally use.  People don't talk quickly, they talk in long meandering sentences, and people listen with patience and respond with long meandering sentences.  The world building is amazingly realistic, think of ""England with magic"" but it's presented in such a matter of fact way, with descriptions and footnotes and side stories that it's easy to get immersed into it. <br/><br/>It's important to keep in mind that the story goes at its own pace and it simply cannot be rushed.  If you follow along, the journey rewards you with an excellent stories and side-stories, interesting characters and satisfying conclusions.   <br/><br/>I can't think this book is for everyone though.  It's a slow burn, the story is dense, the sentences aren't fast, some storeis are relevant some not, there are footnotes, there are conclusions and inconclusions.  For some people, it can feel like a history book and be offputting.  If you're not captivated by page 300, then I suggest not continuing.  I did get into the book's mindset quite early on, so I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Imagine my surprise as well, I had no idea that this author is also the author of Piranesi which I really enjoyed, but these two books aren't even remotely alike!",,,1,0

However I don't think this would be for everyone, so I won't recommend it, and at the same time what worked out for me was knowing nothing at all about the book, just going in blind.  It is my favorite this year (so far).  <br/><br/>Some descriptions and phrases used in the opening chapter were quite confusing and felt unnecessarily verbose. But as soon as it became apparent that the main character has been there for a while, a lot of it started to make sense.  These were his words and his ways of describing things.  That manner of description helps give this place a sense of otherworldliness, and at times it felt like like being in a dreamlike state, a very unique worldbuilding that I've not come across before.  It's melancholic and cozy and haunting and mysterious at the same time.  <br/><br/>I enjoyed most of all the feeling of quietness, being one of the few people there, and the character's love for this weird and imposing place, and his relationship with it.  It's also helped along by their meticulous, diligent nature and their frank manner of speaking, which was refreshing. <br/><br/><br/>The story takes place in this setting, and it becomes quite apparent quite quickly that there is a fascinating mystery in the background, revealed a little at a time, and sometimes an unexplained thing is dropped in a tantalizingly small dose.  The story is unravelled over a short book and the author does it in a riveting way, presenting it, and the people behind the scenes, and the answers to all the mysteries.  Really enjoyed this one.",,,1,0

This book does drop in reminders about things that happened in the first book so it's not necessary to remember every detail.  <br/><br/>I liked how the book gets larger in scope compared to the first, and there are a lot of physical, metaphysical, natural, and supernatural threads tied together to bring the story together.  <br/><br/>There are three main threads here, the CEO, the poet, and the pilgrims (each with  their sub-threads).  All are pretty good to follow.  The poet is a bit odd to follow at first, but it gets better and his purpose is explained.  The CEO is always fun to follow as there are decisions to be made.  And for each pilgrim, there's a bit of further exploration into their stories, and eventually showing how they are all linked to ongoing activities in the story.  <br/><br/>The ending was a bit soppy at times, I'm not a fan of the bullshit clichéd ""love is the greatest force in the universe even science can't understand it hurpy durpy durp"" but thankfully not a lot of time was spent on that particular turd lined avenue.  <br/><br/>A minor peeve was the way in which things contemporary to us readers is treated as 'arcane knowledge' that very few people know about in this futuristic universe, but just a few paragraphs later someone will use another contemporary reference that everyone seems to know about.  Either let it be common knowledge, or just skip it.",,,1,0

They did not.<br/><br/>The story itself, and the world building, is decent.  Enough to keep going and wonder, what happens next.  <br/><br/>What spoils it (once again) is the awful, awful dialogue.  The characters don't know how to <i>talk</i> properly.  There is a heavy helping of modern American slang in there that it's jarring, and you often get expositionary philosophizing in the middle of urgent situations.  While I was able to look past it for the first half, things progressively got worse in the second half, to the point that I was actually cringing. The whole plot seems centred around the characters being able to get their quips in, or reinforce their roles as walking cliches.<br/><br/>Most of it read like fanfiction, and it might have been, by the number of plot holes present and the poorly thought out 'scenarios'.  Someone has been spreading bales of hay around the castle and nobody questions it, seriously?  Could a fire be any more telegraphed than this.   <br/><br/>But from what I can tell of other reviews, that is sort of the point.  Most readers are reading it for the characters, the quality is a secondary point.  This is a far cry from the Ryria Revelations series which was actually quite good.",,,1,0

I've actually read through the series twice now, to pick up on anything I might have missed or to gain a further appreciation.   <br/><br/>The story pacing is quite good, most of the plot doesn't feel dragged out and the action is doled out in generous doses.  There's never a dull moment, so the plot wants to make you keep reading. Each chapter is short so the story doesn't feel interminable.  Speaking overall it feels like the author had a rough idea of where he wanted the story to end up, which is good, though there is a bit of meandering at times, none of it is overdone.  <br/><br/>I think the biggest (and for me most noticeable) let down in the series is the 'other' characters involved, they are pretty poorly written.  They don't really exist to support the main character, which is why I wouldn't call them supporting characters, but 'side characters' is probably a better term.  Instead of supporting, they exist to showcase how powerful the main character is.  <br/><br/>There are certain parts when the story will cut over to them, but only to show how ineffective they are and how impotent their actions become in the face of crisis.  Most of their time is spent observing the main character, and opening their jaws in surprise, swallowing dry saliva or wiping cold sweat off their brow and professing how great the main character is.  Occasionally a very strong character is introduced but again they are only introduced to show their eventual lack of power against the main.  If you've ever watched the Dragonball series, it's similar to the way Goku's friends spend most of their time gaping and commenting.  <br/><br/>And so, sadly, this characterization flaw creeps its way into the villains as well.  Each one is shown to be amazingly powerful, only to be shocked and surprised when they are defeated.  Repeat ad nauseum.  The overall story holds very little tension, you know that the main character has Level 9000 Plot Armor manufactured by Gary Stu Industries.",,,2,0

I wasn't a fan of the 'metaphysical' interludes.  <br/><br/>Storywise, it was overall quite predictable what would happen, and it must have been predictable to the main characters too.  The first part of the book felt wasted in irrelevant and boring side stories, while our favorites were just hanging around waiting for their turn.  <br/><br/>Overall the well done parts are well done, especially the character interactions and the teamwork.

There are no individuals or characters or protagonists or antagonists. The entire 'story' is written almost as a documentary or history book narrated to you the reader, describing various significant events that took place over this time period.  It's not a typical 'story' either - there is no character to relate to, it's just one person's imagination taking what he knew and going forward from there.  <br/><br/>This book is definitely not for everyone, yet I found it very thrilling to read a story in this manner.  The 'scale' at which the story takes place, both in terms of time as well as space, makes for something very vivid and grand to imagine.  It's hard to describe or summarise it well, there's so much that happens, and so many references to different fields and topics.  <br/><br/>It's one of those you-have-to-try-it type books.  And because of the way it's written, it's also going to be one of those you'll-love-it-or-hate-it types.  It reminded me very much of [b:The Three-Body Problem|20518872|The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)|Liu Cixin|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415428227l/20518872._SY75_.jpg|25696480] which was again a similar theme of speculative history over vast amounts of time.  If you liked that series, you'll like this one. <br/><br/>Side note: this book is guaranteed to increase your vocabulary.  It's dense with large words so I found myself long pressing words somewhat frequently compared to other books.",,,1,0

I've never not enjoyed Stormlight Archive, I've even re-read the series even though I rarely ever re-read books.  I've been reflecting a lot since finishing Rhythm of War, and today I realized something.  The author does a fantastic job in any new series he starts; the characters, the world building, the magic, the plot, the mysteries.  Until book 3.  After that, all bets are off.  The plot goes elsewhere, the characters take a hike, the story loses its way, <i>something</i> happens each time.   And this book, <i>Rhythm of War</i> was not exception.  <br/><br/>Where the first three in the series had lots of interesting world building, a varied cast of characters, and a well progressing story, this book takes a sudden turn.  It wasn't enjoyable, the story dragged, the characters became uninteresting, and not much happened, but a lot of stuff gets explained with a great deal of repetition - this could easily have been half the length, maybe less.  Rhythm of War feels like a YA book in tone; YAs aren't bad, they are just written differently with a different set of focus topics in mind.  <br/><br/>What I noticed was, instead of telling a story, the author spends more time <i>preaching modern societal morality and knowledge</i>.  What I mean is, it's quite common in fantasy-setting stories to have a few, just a <i>few</i> instances, where someone is highly progressive in a specific topic, or has a modern set of moralities that reflects that of the readers, or expresses modern scientific knowledge in their own framework of the world. (I wish I knew what this trope was called. Some kind of fantasy-setting-with-modern-englightened-beings.)  These instances are sprinkled about sparingly, acting as a tap on the nose, a little icing on the cake.  It's a little nod to the reader without being too overt.  But no, in Rhythm of War, the author has made it the foundation, the layering, the icing, and empted an entire can of it all over and the can is slathered with it too, and the plate's made of it too... and then you're whacked on the nose and ears for good measure. <br/><br/>It's important to note that the topics are all <i>relevant and important</i> today, however, if you lay it on thick and start to shout the topics at me ad nauseum, it breaks immersion in the story, and I will start judging it based on my knowledge of those topics.  Furthermore, if there are <i>too many</i> of said topics, then the disconnect between those thoughts and the rest of the world building is far too jarring.  There's a reason for making it a nugget of wisdom, not an avalanche of revelations, but the author was perhaps too eager to show all the research they had done.  <br/><br/>Moving on...<br/><br/><b>Kaladin</b> spends most of his time brooding and wallowing in his angst over being unable to save everyone, briefly changing careers for some flimsy reason.  I am convinced that the author hadn't a clue what to do with Kaladin so he just made him do something else for a while, namely working in a clinic, so that he could move on with other character arcs.  Of course mental health is a hot topic currently, so of course Kaladin and Lirin just know that mental health needs to be treated differently than their 'prevailing' wisdom which of course the idiots around them subscribe to.  <br/><br/><b>Navani</b> has become every scientist in human history, all wrapped into one.  The number of revelations and 'hypotheses' she comes up with in a span of a few days easily dwarfs what we normal humans have accomplished in a thousand years.  It got so ridiculous, I actually started taking notes, and I never take notes! She hypothesises over the modern scientific method, the dual nature of light, electricity, magnetism, the standard model of particle physics, matter, anti-matter, space travel, quarks and nuclear power.  <br/><br/><b>Jasnah</b>, not to be left out, of course holds a modern view of how governments ought to work, completely in contradiction to the idiots she's surrounded with.  After all, only the main characters in this series are the enlightened ones, everyone else is of course an idiot who could never comprehend what they are thinking.  All of them come up with these ideas in complete isolation because they are enlightened.  <br/><br/><b>Shallan</b>, whose multiple characters I already found insufferable to begin with, are back and stronger than ever, and there's even more added into the mix.  The people that surround her are completely accustomed to her changing characters, and now we are treated to dialogue and conflict between these characters.  For most of the time she just hides away and does nothing, while her characters sketch in her notebook, waiting for the book to end. <br/><br/>In terms of 'screentime'.  As before, <b>Dalinar</b> gets very little time compared to everyone else and just feels disconnected.  I think he was mostly just staring into the distance.  Szeth just stood next to him.  Jasnah was also pretty much forgotten, with just a few chapters to herself.  <br/><br/>There are a few redeeming moments, like the trial for Adolin which was mostly boring with a decent conclusion, and the story that Wit relates to Kaladin.  <br/><br/>Overall, a slog. I forced myself to persist because this is (was) my favorite series to date.  The payoff wasn't worth it.  Following Goodreads' tooltips, it was OK at best.",,,1,0

The best way I'd describe Lonesome Dove is a Slice-of-Life in the backdrop of a journey out in the Wild West.  Despite this bland description, it was a pleasure going through the story as it progressed at its own pace, there would be chapters of no real events, punctuated by moments in which a great many things of import happen.  <br/><br/>The one thing I took away from this was how harsh life in the Wild West was, and this harsh, unforgiving nature is reflected in every aspect of the story, events, characters.  There are no happy endings for most people, many wandered and eked out a survival, and the lucky ones may simply find a place that they can stay a while.  The land in which they travelled was untamed, and was apathetic to their existence.  <br/><br/>What made the story of course was the cast of characters, each character has a backstory which shaped them to be the way they are, none of them grand, and yet each one larger than life.  All of them are together, but each one carries a loneliness with them.  Gus, who just never shuts up, was someone I found annoying to begin with, and yet he just grew on me, to where I enjoyed his blabbering self.  Call, the ever aloof, silent and disciplined.   The recollection of... a person in Call's past was something I found to be one of the saddest passages I've read in a long time, I felt like I was experiencing the grief that he failed to acknowledge.  And Blue Duck, someone we read very little of but is one of the most terrifying characters I've come across.  His attack on July's camp left me with a sense of loss for what I had been hoping for the first real hint of happiness in July's life.  <br/><br/>After finishing the book I thought about it for several days.  There wasn't anything that particularly stood out, and everything felt memorable to me.  It was just a story, but I wondered what the characters were up to now, where were they going and what were they feeling.    It's strange to describe a book this way but considering that it made my tiny, frozen heart thaw ever so slightly was unexpected... it must mean it's quite something.  ",true,,1,0

It turns out she's just a dumbass. <br/><br/>Most of the story consists of her charging headfirst into new situations without thinking.  She then proceeds to get into trouble, acting out of rage anger fury, almost losing her life several times.  And in every case, she has to be rescued by someone at the last moment.  Repeat ad nauseum.  In other words, her mistakes are consantly being compensated for by the people around her.  There's even one person brought in purely because there was nobody else around to help Ana in one of her life threatening situations, and they knew she was going to get into trouble!  All of this would be fine, if she actually learned lessons from these situations  (hint: she doesn't), much like I should learn not to judge a book by Goodreads reviews (hint: I didn't).  And this dumbass wants to lead the nation...  <br/><br/>But it also got me wondering he she managed to bribe her way in to prison in the opening chapter, as that would have required a degree of planning; perhaps she had a momentary lapse in her inability to think?  I suppose that's what I had been hoping for - more of this planning on her journey to taking back what was hers.<br/><br/>The supporting characters don't help much either.  They barely have any presence, or are barely given any time.  The bad guys are walking cliches who must quip at every opportunity (""Ah I've been expecting you."").  Something about the deaths require supporting characters to spout.  One of the characters, 'May', goes through one of the cringiest death scenes I've ever encountered, who in her last moments keeps prolonging her life by dropping words of wisdom and poetry, you know, like any kid would.  There is additionally a forced attraction between the two main characters; I know this due to the numerous references to his chiseled jaw, and the number of times Ana gets angry at him.  <br/><br/>So while the story has a strong start, things just go downhill from there, spoiled by the characters, interactions and droll story.  I kept reading as there seemed to be the promise of things picking up later, ""Right, this dumb thing but then it's going to get better,"" but it never gets better.  The final seal was when the emperor gets stabbed in <i>the chest</i> in front of everyone and nobody notices.  I had to reread that part multiple times to see that I wasn't missing something.  I wasn't.  <br/><br/>And in the end, the whole 'journey' turned out to be a complete waste of time, as this was simply a flimsy pretext to turn the story to a series.",true,,1,0

I'm now reluctant to read the second Dreyfus book for fear of spoiling this feeling. <br/><br/>There are multiple ongoing threads, each one seemingly unrelated, each one important in its own way.  Different people with different agendas, different problems, backgrounds, stories.  The main character Dreyfus is investigating a main mystery, while still thinking about other mysteries from his own past. All while there's an ongoing crisis in this part of the galaxy.  <br/><br/>And though all of these things are seemingly unrelated or tenuously linked, the way they are brought together over the course of the story is nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>This can be read standalone independently of the Revelation Space series, but it's good when read together.

It appears her purpose is to serve as nothing but a convenience function, who also happens to be, and I quote ""I'm rich"" - yeah, nobody says that unless they've just won a lottery.<br/><br/>  <br/>The story, well, is just too convenient.  Absolutely every hotel they visit on their hunt for information has the right people giving the right information at the right time remembering the right things or saying the right things.

And they act just like humans, from mannerisms to motivations.  I tried to look past it, but it was simply too jarring. <br/><br/>The first book's characters are pretty much done away with, to introduce a slew of new boring characters that I didn't care about, in a complex mire of inane alien politics which have no bearing on the first book's continuity.  <br/><br/>This author's stories are normally well thought through and have fantastic continuity, just not this particular series.

A lot of such behavior would (pardon the pun) fly well in normal story settings, it just doesn't work in high-precision, high-speed, high-safety situations despite me trying to suspend disbelief.  <br/><br/>The plot however is interesting enough, there is the usual mysterious world building with lost knowledge and hints dropping through every once in a while.

I read on hoping that some of the aspects of the story would be clarified or explained in some way.  But it never happens.

The glossary should be at the front in this case - the reader then knows to bookmark and jump back and forth. Glossary aside, the publishers have made no effort to incorporate Kindle X-Ray information to assist the reader.  This book needed these features to help.  Either that, or the author needed to tone down the rapid fire a few notches.  <br/><br/>From the middle of the book onwards I struggled to keep track of the relevant and irrelevant characters and though I did my best to follow along I was merely skimming the surface.  <br/><br/>A decent atmospheric story overall, let down by overzealous pedantry.

And so much had changed. If the Goodreads awards actually took place at a non-idiotic, somewhat-sensible time (end of the year) this likely deserved a place there. Unfortunately it's likely this book will be overlooked in the next cycle.  <br/><br/>James Holden is now Olden! The time period has shifted decades since the last book and the human universe looks a lot different than it did in the past.  And the Roci's crew is older, wiser.  The years have made them comfortable with each other in a way of a family.  <br/><br/>There's now a face to a more powerful enemy than before - the Laconians. I actually liked a lot of the people from their side.  Singh, with his inexperience, sent in as nothing more than a symbolic scapegoat.  They knew full well he would fail at his job.  Trejo, he just exudes warmth and villainy.  And above all, Duarte - his way of thinking big and long term.  <br/><br/>Most of the story is the crew of the Roci now on Medina station, fighting back against the cruel authority and working on their escape plan.  All the while fighting their own inner battles, it was quite insightful to see how unhinged Amos was getting, Bobbi with her brief taste of captaincy, Naomi+Jim and their inability to escape saving people again.  We see a lot of people at their prime, especially Naomi, Bobbi and their planning; despite knowing how the plans would go, it was still a thrill to read the planning and execution.  To see these old timers working here felt like them performing their swan song (albeit across the next 3 books)<br/><br/>What I liked most was the way the Expanse 'universe' had been set up for us in all the previous 6 books but it gets upended in a smooth, logical way to something I hadn't expected at all.  Further, I greatly disliked #6 (Babylon's Ashes) and it seems like a lot of the slowness there was just a goodbye to the 'younger' crew and making way for the 'older' more experienced.",true,,1,0

And finally it arrives at the finale of this journey with an absolutely massive scope.  However - just like the first book - it's not for everyone and a lot of it comes down to characterization.  None of the characters have any meaning, despite there being a protagonist, they are all props.  The real story is happening all around, and this is not a common concept in many other books, so this story can feel very dismal.  It is a bit of a mind shift and once accustomed to the author's tone, everything falls into place.  <br/><br/>This third book reads more as a documentary than as a story like the first two books.  Yet it's the most gripping of the three, and to be honest it's also the most terrifying.  Each new idea or concept that emerges is interesting and the author manages to turn it into yet another reason to fear everything.  <br/><br/>The main protagonist here, Cheng Xin, is a moron.  There isn't really a better way to put it, but for some reason it didn't seem to matter; the people just don't matter in the overall scheme of what's actually happening.  <br/><br/>What's most enjoyable about this is the fresh, complicated ideas crammed in every chapter.  It's like reading some Asimov for the first time, a new world of ideas and concepts opens up, those ideas are built upon, torn down, resurrected in new ways... there isn't a way to recreate it afterwards.  But the feeling lingers and it's enjoyable.  <br/><br/>I'll be having a look at some of the other offerings by this author but won't be expecting another journey like this one.",,,1,0

There are no qualms here, everyone is just an idea and the real focus here is the grand interstellar story.<br/><br/>Most enjoyable is the thought process - people thinking in long terms, decades, centuries; actions and consequences.  Deciphering and understanding what may seem like initially vague words or actions into concrete explanations.<br/><br/>I've not read something like this before which made it very interesting.

I'd stop short of calling it a deus-ex though it did approach something close to it... <br/><br/>Part of the problem in here is now the sheer <b>number of characters</b>.  The scope of the story is now wider than before, and that wideness makes it a bit shallow in terms of storytelling.  The original main character, Arlen, is still now one-of-many.  I understand the necessity of this - more people need to have their actions shown - but he still receives very little time.  <br/><br/>Some <b>threads get tied up</b> pretty well - It's good to see the various squabbling factions putting their differences aside out of necessity, or at least resolve them for a little while.  The looming threat's importance is made quite clear to everyone. <br/><br/>While it's always great to see strong female leads in a story, it needs to be balanced out properly to give it some context. In my opinion, this series has not done well in that aspect and has gone for the easier approach of  ""<b>woman smart, man dumb</b>"" trope - the male leads are either gone or relegated to background roles; those that stick around are constantly being put down or shouted at.  Reminds me of the Wheel of Time series - minus the braid tugging and sniffing.<br/><br/>The <b>'tension'</b> of the previous books is gone.  The humans have gotten better at fighting the demons so the original fear that pervaded demon encounters was now a matter of just getting the encounter over with while everyone draws wards faster than breathing.  However this was to be expected, after all it was Arlen and Rojer's purpose to make people stronger by giving them the necessary tools.<br/><br/>The conversations between <b>Jardir and Arlen</b> were well done - the constant undercurrent of challenge and rivalry was well written as their stories progressed.  They have matured well through their experiences over time and with each other.  But as I said before - <b>not much screen time</b> or development!  It's not enjoyable when a series goes from 1 protagonist to 20, much more preferable when this is done from book 1 rather than book 3, because the expectation is usually set early on. <br/><br/>Overall - nowhere near the hyped 5* reviews this book is currently receiving, but not so bad either.  A good simple series to read.",,,1,0

It greatly helped with picking up on references which would have been lost otherwise, there's so much going on it's easy to forget. The war is now a real thing, it's begun and hands are being revealed, even more mysteries are raising questions. <br/><br/><b>Dalinar was... amazing</b>.  The flashbacks combined with the finale, deftly woven together and blended in to the overall story, that writing felt like a piece of art in itself - well done to the author.  Of everyone in there, his development was the most enjoyable.  Around him, the story flowed and was truly brought to life.  Though not a king, he felt grander than one.  <br/><br/><b>Shallan was annoying</b>.  Sad to say I didn't enjoy reading her parts. She's doing too much, all the time.   One moment she's lamenting herself, the next she is playing multiple people, multiple powers, multiple quests, multiple achievements, multiple interests.  The result is that her part in the story is stretched-out, shallow and ultimately felt meaningless to me.  It's lucky that she was surrounded by others who progressed at a better, more meaningful rate. <br/><br/><b>Kaladin was reduced</b>.  Though featured, it sometimes felt like he was added in as an afterthought, with not enough 'meat'.  He fulfilled some roles but spent time running around. In the afterglow of finishing the book, his story was the least distinct.  Hmm.  I've seen this in other series before - the author starts ignoring one of the main characters, bringing others to the front and I sincerely hope this does not carry on in the next book.  I do half worry that at some point BranSan will simply kill him off.  Or worse, forget about him. <br/><br/><b>Jasnah was ignored</b> - she returns from the dead and... nothing?  I would have thought her relationship with her ward would have been explored further, but again, due to Shallan's superhero status, this part just falters.<br/><br/><b>Szeth felt fresh</b> - had not expected such a turnaround, and I feel his 'conflict' with everyone else will come to the fore in the next book, looking forward to it.  After all, the assassin is here, in the middle of the thing he started! <br/><br/>There are others who became a bit more interesting this time - Navani, Renarin.  And Wit. <br/><br/>Aside from the characters, something that really surprised me - the number of <b>typos</b> and spelling/grammatical mistakes.  Perhaps the proofreaders were enjoying themselves too much to notice?  Luckily - Kindle has a report content feature, so hopefully this made its way back to the publishers.  Or not.<br/><br/><b>Overall</b> - compared to the first two, this third book isn't as fast paced, nor does it have as many moments where you're experiencing this world for the first time.  Instead - the world building is pretty much done, people are now being moved into place and stories, conflicts and plots are progressing.  <br/><br/>As always, my favourite series.  I hope I am not dead by the time the 10th book is out.",true,,1,0

Here's why: book 1 came out in 2010. Book 2 is coming out in 2013. This series is planned to be 10 books long. Which means, if everything is alright and there are no unexpected developments or surprised, at the absolute very least, it will take around 25 to 30 years for it to complete. <br/><br/>There's no way this can last. There are too many variables involved, especially for someone as busy as this particular author is.  The author may lose interest, or I might, or it might take longer.  I might be dead before this series is over. So I could end up going to go to my grave not knowing how this ends. <br/><br/>As for the story itself, it's fantastic - there are twists and turns constantly and the best part is how they are almost always completely unexpected. My favorite part is how nothing in the story is wasted. Every seemingly insignificant detail is significant and in some surprising way.

It felt like there were a series of historical places, names and events which were being included for the sake of being ticked off a list, not annoying but at times it felt a bit gratuitous and may have contributed towards a less tightly-knit tale.<br/><br/>The main characters were as strong and memorable as ever.  Ned, Margery, Sylvie, Alison, Pierre, Rollo, Barney, Bart.  Well developed in good measure and necessary to the overall story.  The geographic span of the story however caused events, plots and villains to feel vast and distant. <br/><br/>What I liked most was the insight into the religious conflicts and what drove the hatred and motivations of people at the time.   Why the countries went to war and cared so much about who the monarch was; why the people cared about who the monarch was.  It's easy to take a lot of today's freedoms for granted but this glimpse into the past does put it into perspective.  It's not perfect in this day and age but is certainly better.<br/><br/>As a <b>standalone historical story</b>, it can stand on its own and is pretty entertaining overall.  <br/>As a <b>Kingsbridge story</b>, it doesn't hold any of the charm and fascination that the #1 and #2 did, it was just out-of-place.",,,1,0

A lot of things felt quite familiar - there were the usual small town folk with their petty ways, the lechery, the manipulative clergy, the forward thinkers and the absolute villains.  <br/><br/>In this book however, I found the characters a lot more likable - the villains included.  It was quite good to see their motivations, deceptions and deviousness, thoroughly enjoyable.   It was also a treat to see the never ending adversities faced while our various protagonists and antagonists went about their goals.  And the construction involved too.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, we watch the fates of an entire generation centered around a town.<br/><br/>Sometimes the messages the author was inserting were a bit too obvious and at times immersion-breaking.  Some of the characters thought and spoke in a manner similar to people today, even some of the expressions were very weird to encounter.  One example of language is 'piss off' - which was first used in the early 1900s.  Not getting to deep into other examples but you'll know them when you see the gay rights, the social changes, the 'forward thinking'...  not in a bad way, just in a weird way.<br/><br/><br/>Good enjoyable read - if you liked Pillars of the Earth and the environment around it, this one's perfect to get back into it",,,1,0

The book manages to not take itself too seriously but at the same time keeps things level.  <br/><br/>Cliches are at a minimum - you can't write one of these without a bunch of rinsed and repeated devices, but there aren't the annoyingly ubiquitous ones, like the washed out detective who's tired of life, with the only recourse to drown in alcohol.<br/><br/>Although this is 3rd in a series, it's modular enough so that you don't need to know about the previous ones. <br/><br/>Some parts of the narrative felt unnecessary, such as some people being described as 'a person' with an entire chapter talking about what this person is doing, without actually naming them.

Not in terms of first 'memorable' lines - I mean in terms of introducing you into the story.  A memorable first line is something to spout at pseudointellectual battles or classrooms; a memorable first chapter is something that you experience and that sets the tone for the rest of the book.   This had the perfect blend of humor as well as a gradual, expansive scene being set.  Very well done. <br/><br/>This third book, Saint's Blood, is as serious and humorous as the series has ever been.  The action doesn't stop and neither do the twists, revelations and insurmountable odds.  Falcio, Kest and Brasti are tired, and you can feel it, but they keep going because it's what they must do - sounds like a dreary topic but it's very well presented.  The world has been well built, there is an evil scheme afoot and plans are revealed, odds are stacked against these three and their companions; the companions aren't flat or boring, each one is distinct and nobody's presence felt like a chore, not even the Cogneti (sp?).  The interjection of duelling amidst the revelations was a refreshing touch as well.<br/><br/>Some of the questions you'll have had in the first two books are addressed here, though not all.  That's reserved for the fourth book, Tyrant's Throne (which was confusingly the working title for this book before it was changed).  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Only one criticism:<br/>Falcio is overly-coddled.  Everyone else in this book knows exactly what he's thinking and the deep, hidden meaning behind his actions and they bend themselves around him to accommodate his despair and actions, wherein he will by virtue of plot armor go against the odds and win in the end anyway.  In other words, it was getting a bit predictable (to me anyway).  ",,,1,0

I have finished reading this book.  I should probably rate it because that's what normal people would do.  But I am not a normal person.  I don't need to rate a book, everyone should just understand.  But I will do it anyway because normal people expect that and their faces get shiny when I don't.  <br/><br/>I can make my kneecaps click at certain angles. Goodreads says I have to decide on a number of stars.  Why do people use stars, stars are balls of incandescent gas, billions of miles away.  But they are using gas to indicate how they felt about a book.  That's like showing an upward thumb when you approve of something.  An upward thumb should only be used to determine the direction of a magnetic field around a current, but normal people are strange like that, always doing one thing but meaning another.  <br/><br/>I should find other ways to highlight how not normal I am.  I wonder if that's something I do a lot.  <br/><br/>I need to cut my fingernails.  It is difficult to rate this book, it has a strange smell.  I like to smell things and people near me, but it is hard to grasp this one.  I wonder if normal people smell books, they probably don't.  How can normal people read books without smelling it?<br/><br/>Sweat is trickling down my ass crack.  I am unsure how to proceed.   Goodreads says I should rate a book 1 star if I didn't like it.  But that would be giving points to something I don't like.  This is not right, Goodreads should not act like a normal person and say one thing but do another it is supposed to be a neutral ground of logic.  I am looking at what others are doing nothing makes sense everyone is giving 5 stars to books even if they don't read it normal people are strange I am not normal I am very smart.<br/><br/>I have chosen three incandescent balls of gas in the heavens.

Now I should justify my rating because normal people's ears start oscillating if I don't and it is the polite thing to do.  <br/><br/>The protagonist.  <br/><br/>The protagonist is very smart and the author reminds us of how clever and not normal they are.

I would say they are black and white but they are in color, so they cannot be black and white.  Television displays used to be black and white.  Anyway they are all normal and everyone is either very good or very evil.  <br/><br/>I do not understand the protagonist's motivation towards the end.   It is rushed and of little import.  Why do normal authors do this if I were an author I would not do this but I am not normal I am smart.<br/><br/>The story reminded me of Flowers for Algernon probably because it was very similar but I could not relate to the protagonist much.

They get bound together by a spell and travel north to 'rescue' Snorri's family.  It turns out they're part of a bigger plan to stop the Dead King who's raising unborns.  They eventually stop the Unborn Captain by clasping hands (he was light, Snorri was dark) and there's some kind of explosion.  Snorri's family has been all fucked up and he never gets to rescue them.  Jal also finds out that the Silent Sister is his uncle Garyus' twin.  The Red Queen (his grandma) has some awareness of this but it wasn't clear from the book.<br/><br/>At the end Snorri has the key that can open anything and the Red Queen mentioned earlier that there was an actual physical door to death.  Presumably this key can open the door, but I'm not sure why.</spoiler>",true,,1,0

It was also quite helpful by mentioning the altitudes above mean tide water.  Occasionally there would be notes on interesting places on the route too along with the descriptions of the formations.  <br/><br/>Despite my favorable review of this book, I feel that the movie adaptation of this book did a far better job.

But I don't think that should factor in anywhere; years from now someone else picking up this series should not really care whether someone began writing it and someone else finished it.  It also shouldn't matter that the ebook is going to come out months later, quite possibly a calculated move to maximize revenue, I found it extremely disappointing.  What matters is that the core of a series, any series, is the story.<br/><br/>There's the part in a series, when the various threads, subplots and mysteries are resolved - the <i>denouement</i>.  This is the goal of the entire series.  You accompany the characters on their journeys and allow the little mysteries accrue around them, being promised their resolutions.  And so you persevere and you carry on.<br/><br/>What often happens is this - the author (RJ) gets so lost in their world that they end up creating too much.  They get carried away and the original goals are forgotten.  There are a few ways to deal with this.  One is to turn metaphysical and absolve responsibility (see: <i>Lost</i> finale) , another is to ignore all previous threads and create a climax unrelated (see <i>A Memory of Light</i>).  Here we get all the characters over the past series in a series of tepid battle scenes.  However, that is all they are.  There is no denouement.  <br/><br/>None of the attributes which drew us to the characters have any relevance.  They are simply present in an endless series of permutation cameos to please all fans.  We learn that everything before this has very little meaning; not everything, you can scrape the barrel a bit and there will be a few meaningful lines followed.  Yet the multitude of threads and subplots remain frayed and ignored.  The divisions, diversions, directions, diversions, quests, all of it, almost meaningless.  Bloody and bloody ashes, even death is a temporary paragraph in the chaotic, loosely coupled story segments thrown about as the battle goes on.  It's tough, having to fit all these characters and all these people into one part of a 14 part series.  Each person gets a small amount of screen time and you're left with quantity over quality.<br/><br/>But the series stays true to its roots.  Braids are tugged, men are put down, Rand feels woolheaded around all three of his lovers (as you do) and the women bicker right through the final battle.  <br/><br/>Overall it's somewhat satisfactory, knowing that it has actually ended.  It isn't satisfactory knowing that this was going to happen eventually. The saving grace in all of this is the style of Brandon Sanderson's writing, who  manages to keep the pace fast and does his best to keep you interested enough to keep reading. ",,,1,0

The first half of the book keeps a very good pace and progression of the story.<br/><br/>The second half is where it all falls down.  First, there appears to be some kind of obsession with Summers Presley, wherein we are reminded of just how gorgeous she is on every page.  The bickering and in-fighting and to-ing-and-fro-ing of power on the ship that the story descends into has no purpose at all.  At the end, there were no consequences of the actions that both sides took, it felt more like a filler.  The whole in-fighting could have been cut out of the story and no difference would have been made.<br/><br/>I also feel this book makes a big mistake towards the end.  We are told about a mysterious organization and strange forces working behind the scenes, but instead of being given a big plot-piece or any good details to keep us looking towards the second book of the series, we are given a bland conversation in which Raidan repeats, seemingly to the reader, ""Trust me, it's big.

It's common to have the author introduce them to make their fantasy world 'more real'.  What authors don't do is tying up those loose ends, explaining any legends or histories.  Their main focus is the final conflict which ends and everything else is forgotten.<br/><br/>This is the first series I've read where all of these subplots, myths, legends, histories and minor characters are actually part of the story.  What's more, small references made in book 1 are important in book 6.  A sentence that someone said in passing becomes important too.  The legends and histories are all part of the story.  Reading all 6 of these books, you see that no sentence, person, statement or story is wasted.  Absolutely everything is relevant.  So it's absolutely satisfying to see the way everything comes together (everything).<br/><br/>It's as though the author planned all 6 books in advance and actually stuck to the plot and ideas formed as far back as book 1.

Everything takes a backseat to Locke and Sabetha's 'romance'.  I put romance in quotes because it is more of an unending series of inane conversations of meta-analysis wherein Locke mopes and Sabetha tries to explain why they can't be together, and then running away every so often for reasons known only to her.  The author is trying very hard to say ""Look!  Our Locke is fascinated by her but she is alluring and mysterious and out of his grasp and it's unrequited love!  I'll make it all happen again just in case you missed it the first time! <b>Unrequited love!</b>""<br/><br/><br/>Compound this with the dual-story narrative.  The old world where all the youngsters were together at an important point in their lives.  The new world where it's Locke vs Sabetha in a game of politics.  While still mingling and continuing their <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>I found the old world weird.  It had a few cult-ish ceremonies (think back to the temples) which felt like reading a B-movie.  A few interesting threads of the wit we come to expect, but mostly a lot of moping and sulking for no real reasons other than to set the basis of their <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>The new world could have been better.  Though it is a Locke vs Sabetha contest, there isn't much to speak of about it.  It was OK.  It happens in the background.  A few mentions are made.  Again, because it isn't the focus of the narrative, it is something happening behind the scenes and some things take care of themselves.  As a result, in trying to tie things together, a lot of things happen for no reason but hey don't forget the <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>It also feels too movie like.  It's trying to play like a movie where there is more attention on getting characters into various situations and the reasons aren't important even if they sound silly.  Scenes are left half finished and just in case I haven't mentioned it, <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>The big 'reveal' about the Bondsmagi felt more pointless.  The big 'reveal' about Locke's past felt pointless, it was a deus ex out of nowhere just to further intensify their <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>Overall the book is not what you expect from one in the series, it tries to do too much and be too much and it lacks excitement because of that.  I feel some of the story elements should have been done away with, made it more streamlined and maybe dealt with the other elements later. Maybe even do away with the <b>Unrequited love!</b><br/><br/>While it was a mostly lacklustre read, some parts do still stand out as gems and so the 2 star rating instead of 1.  <br/><br/>By the way in case you missed it, <b>Unrequited love!</b>",,,1,0

I can't say I enjoyed this very much and I can't see what other reviewers are raving about.  It didn't feel like a Brandon Sanderson novel or even a Reckoners story; this one felt flat and one-dimensional, like a young adult/juvenile fantasy.  <br/><br/>I was constantly reminded how 'nerdy' David was (who wasn't). I was constantly reminded how 'real' or 'cute' Mizzy was (meh). The running gag about the bad metaphors was simply cringeworthy. New worldbuilding-physics was introduced but without much of a preamble, it simply 'just was' and nobody could explain it.  A lot of time was wasted as David just mopes, the villains make vague threats and Megan is her usual beautiful, mysterious self.  Sparks, I was constantly reminded how 'beautiful' Megan was.  That David, such an awkward nerdy geeky slontze.  (just stop)<br/><br/>Every character had one 'quirk' or grudge about something, and several of them played like cliched or poorly written side characters in superhero movies.  <br/><br/>The core story itself was quite good but it felt spoiled by the interpersonal interactions.  I'll still read the next in the series - Calamity - to find out if any of the mysteries are explained (also just because Brandon Sanderson).<br/><br/>",,,1,0

The inconsistencies between paragraphs in this way is quite jarring and kills anything that could evoke interest.  <br/><br/>While this may have been excellent social commentary 200 years ago, I fail to see why it appears on so many ""best books ever"" lists today.  It has no relevance now and only imparts poor moralities to the people who read it today, implying that you should be judged by your fortune and class and connections.

The concept and historical context are quite interesting overall, especially the community factor and details around the building of the Kingsbridge Cathedral.<br/><br/>Where it lacks, though, is the black and white nature of the characters themselves.  There are good and bad people but very little in between.  <br/><br/>Good people are absolutely good and just and the bad people are the devil incarnate.  The bad people keep tormenting the good people and the good people keep suffering.  And it's in all small ways as well as big so it all adds up to create a community of the most unfortunate people on the planet.<br/><br/>And just when you think things can't get any worse, they do get worse.  Maybe the unending strings of unfortunate incidents was part of the story style to make the reader feel endless despair, but a thousand pages of this is a bit too much.

Perhaps a demonstration in his in-depth knowledge of historical events and contexts, albeit of no useful purpose.<br/><br/>The worst bit, in my opinion, was the attempts at prose.  Describing a flight taking off or sun setting against a quiet backdrop, these weren't relevant at all to the topic at hand (in case you've forgotten, the topic was <b><i>""world without us""</b></i>).  It's as though the whole book was written with a documentary targeted in mind already.  The author seems to be describing the scenes as he would like them filmed for the inevitable documentary.

And distractingly, all the made-up words.<br/><br/>The fantasy world that the author creates for this book is given too much detail, and a lot of it was unnecessary, or just there for the sake of being there.  It kept repeating to the reader, ""Look at how different this world is! It's like a perfect society of dream and magic!  Everyone does things differently here!"".  There's no gradual buildup, instead the details are dumped on you almost all at once.<br/><br/>It also has way too many rules that felt superfluous and hollow in what is supposed to be a near idyllic society where everyone is happy and nobody has doors in their houses and nobody is corrupt and nobody hides their thoughts from each other and if you do it's rude.  ◔_◔<br/><br/>Of course the plotline is based around the existence of corruption in this perfect society.  Some of the protagonists simply can't believe it and spend an inordinate amount of time reeling in shock over the implications of this.  <br/><br/>Overall the characters felt too clean-cut, lack any depth, and the storyline failed to pull me in.  <br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

I'd place it a level above the basic popular-science books such as A Brief History of Time and A Short History of Nearly Everything and The Elegant Universe.  The best parts are bringing together the behavior of quantum mechanics to the early stages of the universe leading to why we observe certain properties of spacetime the way they are.  It was also written a few years ago making it more modern and bringing in the latest advancements in physics.  It was however written shortly before the LHC opened up, but it does reference the Higgs Boson being one of the main goals of the LHC and what it would mean if it was found.<br/><br/>The only negative is the analogies.  Wow, the analogies are bad.  They are stale, outdated, forced and detract from the point that the author is trying to make.  In fact, they're so bad, the author has to explain it again right after the analogies.  I feel the analogies may have made sense to the author and the editors at the time but it was obvious, or should have been obvious, that these would not stand the test of time.  Perhaps it was an attempt to connect with a certain audience by referencing their TV shows all the time, but that won't last and won't make sense.  It's just... BAD. <br/>",,,1,0

We want more of the clever plans and schemes that Locke and Jean concoct and see through.  Just as in the first book, there is a vast, elaborate plan in place in order to steal something - which is just what we want, it's why we read this series in the first place.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is where it falters and diverges.<br/><br/>First - the vast, elaborate plan has too many 'silences'.  It's those things which the author deliberately doesn't reveal to the reader to save it for the end.  Whoa - the protagonist just whispered something to that other person.  And they talked about that thing.  Oh and then he went out and bought a whole bunch of mysterious things.  Then he told another person and they were surprised and said, ""What a crazy plan! You'll never pull it off!""  but they went ahead with it anyway! WHOA.  The immediate problem there is that it's obviously being held back and gets irritating when that 'silence' is referred to again and again.  Even more infuriating is if the revelation of this 'silence' is a lacklustre, underwhelming piece of information of no consequence.  That's what happens here, the secrets are all for naught.   <br/><br/>Second - there were too many threads.  Too many things were happening and we lose focus of the main threads.  Instead, they are all diluted, none of the imminent victories are savoured and there is no focus, there is nothing to look forward to.  This proves itself in the climax when everything is rushed together towards the end and everything somehow resolves itself.  It was a meh moment.  <br/><br/>And finally, the most important bit, where we want our heroes to accomplish the task they set out for.  Putting a twist on the reader is OK, no, it's good.  Catches us by surprise.  But when the twist becomes this underwhelming, festering, stale piece of garbage, appearing to be a twist for the sake of being a twist - no.  Just no.  What the hell are you doing.  What was all this time and emotional investment for?  Nothing.  <br/><br/>So overall, the main story, the actual meat of it - it's stale and boring.<br/><br/>What does shine through is the writing.  Some genuinely good writing, a good sense of clever, sly humor.  Great character development.  I even had a few laugh out loud moments.  This whole book is about Jean and Locke, through and through.<br/><br/>But damn, the story was shit. <br/><br/>This is an unfortunate characteristic of series that gain popularity.  The author may have had an overarching storyline in mind, but the immense success of the first causes the author to overthink and overreach.  We end up with way too much in subsequent novels and nobody's expectations are met.  <br/><br/>I can only imagine that this disappointment I am experiencing is the same feeling I have given to many women over the years.

Molly, Kettricken, Fool, Burrich, even Will and Regal in their hatred.<br/><br/>The author has a nice writing style which is engrossing at times.<br/><br/><b>But there a lot of things that make this trilogy a bad one</b><br/><br/>A lot of questions were introduced, a lot of story points, but none of the questions were answered.  It seems like the author got lost in his own fantasy world and had to hurriedly wrap up the story and tie up any loose ends. <br/><br/>I've seen this far too often in the past when reading other series, and the patterns are usually recognizable: nothing significant happens until the last few chapters and <b>BAM!</b> suddenly there is a superpower and everything is resolved and back to normal and the enemies are defeated and people are happy and peace and prosperity return and there is smiling and dancing and joy. <br/><br/>In this case, nothing happens for two whole books until the very end, but instead our blundering hero makes his way across the land, getting beat up at every turn and living inside his obliviousness to obviousness.  <br/><br/>This obliviousness to obviousness extended to other characters too.  Let's see, Shrewd is being poisoned, which is obvious, but let us do nothing.  Why? Chade says that nothing should be done about this.  But why?  Because Chade said so.  Also, Molly had to 'take care of someone else' - which was an obvious reference to her being pregnant.  But Fitz doesn't realize this.<br/><br/><b>Poor threads and subplots</b><br/><br/>Why were the red ships attacking the coast?  Some flimsy pretence in the last chapter about black stones being a source of power...  An afterthought by the author.  I felt insulted at this.  The whole premise of the story was the mysterious enemy harassing the coastline.  All we get at the end is one paragraph about it.  ONE paragraph.  And if they were truly sources of power, why hold a ransom about returning them or killing them?  Why does the ransom matter at all?  <br/><br/>Why were the 'old blood' introduced only to be dismissed and never heard from again?  ""Hey Fitz, we're just like you.  Look at how amazing and in control we are.  We can help!""  Fitz just says no, and that's the end of that. I think they were there just to add some intrigue into the story but it didn't go anywhere. <br/><br/>Elderlings are dragons.  Oh look, it's this plot device again.  When all else fails, add dragons to your story.  Have your protagonists rely on the supernatural power of the dragons to solve all their problems. But even before that's revealed, it's spoiled by the cover of the book.  Why would you refer to the mysterious Elderlings and then slap it on the cover of the book and give it all away?  That's like the Chinese version of Sixth Sense, called ""He's a ghost"".  <br/><br/><b>About Fitz...</b><br/><br/>I also think this series shouldn't have been named around assassins as it leads to a false sense of what Fitz really is.  He is not an assassin.  You see, an assassin assassinates.  Fitz, well, Fitz just blunders.  He gets involved in court intrigue and nobility and plotting and scheming even though he may deny it. Sure, he might take part in the occasional killing.  But he is not an assassin.  <br/><br/>Also, he sleeps a lot.  I lost count of the number of chapters that ended with him falling asleep and chapters that started with him waking up, having had a dream that he did not fully understand.  <br/><br/><b>The ending does matter</b><br/><br/>I've often heard that it is the journey that matters, not the ending.  I invite you to book a flight to Singapore and turn back as soon as you reach Changi Airport.  I disagree of course - the ending is more important to me, if not as important as the rest of the story.  I would conceive that the author has some idea of an ending before starting the story and not lead us the way that Robert Jordan did.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy reading the style of writing here, but it didn't <i>go</i> anywhere.  If you've ever been friendzoned, then this is it, in the most literary sense.<br/><br/>Other series do manage to pull off a good ending.  For me, these are LOTR, Mistborn, Northern Lights, First Law, Saga of the Seven Suns, Daughter of the Empire.  Those are thought out, well contained storylines. <br/><br/>I found it somewhat frustrating, having spent a significant chunk of emotional time into a series, led onwards with the lure of an ending worthy of being remembered, only to see such a lacklustre ending.<br/><br/><b>Book 1 - 3 stars</b><br/><br/>This is the best book of the series as it is young and fresh and there is a lot of potential set up.  <br/><br/><br/><b>Book 2 - 3 stars</b><br/><br/>This has a more mature Fitz and it keeps you interested throughout just enough to start reading the third book.<br/><br/><b>Book 3 - 1 star</b><br/>The story takes a completely different direction, there are new characters, a meaningless quest, and suddenly every woman is hitting on Fitz.  Oh, to be Fitz.<br/><br/><b>Final rating</b><br/><br/>System.Math.Floor((3+3+1)/3) = 2 stars.",true,,1,0

It's a series of short stories related to each other and spanning millennia. It's also full of extremely intelligent characters who are able to grasp in an instant long term implications and meanings of thoughts and actions. <br/><br/>It's surprisingly well written in terms of scifi-science and the cultures, economies and history that those circumstances would lead us to.<br/><br/>The first story which takes place around this time in history is the least exciting one of all but is an important one as it is the setup for everything that follows.

It's a bit more serious, well written and has a better storyline.  <br/><br/>I found myself enjoying the Roran chapters a lot more than any of Eragon's feats.  It somehow seemed more heroic to be able to accomplish and do everything he did, compared to the all-powerful Eragon who has a dragon and a magical belt and some mysterious book and amazing rings and a supernatural sword and all these powerful friends.  Further, because of his limitations in the context of that world, Roran had a tougher task(s) to perform.  I feel that Roran himself could be the protagonist of a series of his own.<br/><br/>The inevitable climactic confrontation wasn't very exciting, it felt rushed and cliched, with a slight hint of deus-ex thrown in.  The confrontation that everyone was rushing towards wasn't really all that, it was too short and seemed to pass by with very little impact.<br/><br/>The ending was morose and left me with a feeling of sadness.  I'm glad it wasn't a perfect 'everyone lived happily ever after' ending, it wouldn't have been appropriate.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, there seem to have been too many threads from previous books for the author to tie up and he did a good job of trying to keep the mystery alive with a semi-open end.

I liked that the author did her research or is familiar with computers enough to make the technological accomplishments believable and not cringe-inducing. <br/><br/>The story itself takes a bit to get started and once it does, it'll have your attention. <br/><br/>The protagonists were likeable and i particularly enjoyed falsens, then emmie.
